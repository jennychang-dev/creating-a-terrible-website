    <h1>Jenny Chang</h1>
    <p>iOS Developer experienced working with both Objective-C and Swift. Recently moved from London (UK) where I worked in finance/data analysis roles. At Fitch, I learnt how to create macros using Visual Basic and that was where I discovered how much I enjoy programming. I thrive in situations where Iâ€™m out of my comfort zone and feel pressured to push myself, as demonstrated through passing CFA Level I with no prior financial knowledge.</p>
